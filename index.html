              <p>The songs had almost all been written, the studio had been booked, and EMI, anticipating an easy process, set a release date only a few months away. “Every three or four days, the record company or manager would turn up to hear these hit singles,” recalled producer John Leckie, “And all we’d done was get a drum sound or something.” Weeks passed. “There was a lot of ‘Jonny’s got to have a special sound…’ We spent days hiring in different amplifiers and weird guitars for him. In the end, he used what he’d been using for the last couple of years.” Thom Yorke called it “painful self-analysis, a total fucking meltdown.” The band missed its deadline by almost six months.

                    If the recording process for Radiohead’s second album, The Bends, sounds torturous, it also sounds like how they recorded most of their other albums. The band had to take a break in the middle of the frustrating OK Computer sessions. Kid A spanned 18 months and half a dozen different studios. In Rainbows took two and a half years.

                      <p><em><strong>“There are many things to talk about”</em></strong>: On Kid A, Radiohead explored the medium of collage. Scraps of instrumentation and snatches of melody were assembled, cut, and reassembled; lyrics were written in clumps of one or two lines and paired with other clumps for color or contrast. This might make the album seem nonsensical, the central theme impenetrable, but the fragments are the whole point. It’s a perfect wedding of form and content; the album takes place in a confusing world where a bump on the head and “Where’d you park the car?” and nightmares about the kids being cut in half all get rolled into a single ball of anxiety; it’s about the struggle to make sense of all these individual moments, these fragments you don’t understand, all while somehow keeping your sanity.
                        <br>
                        <em><strong>“Siren singing you to shipwreck”</em></strong>: There’s another version of “Motion Picture Soundtrack” — less singular, more by-the-numbers, with the refrain “I think you’re crazy, maybe” stretched out into a conventional hook, and the backing of strings and a grand piano — that could do quite nicely for whichever brooding songstress finds herself the flavor du jour. “White wine and sleeping pills/ Help me get back to your arms.” And all the sad schoolgirls nod their heads. With a melody simple enough that anyone could hum it and catchy enough that anyone could find it stuck in their heads, “Motion Picture Soundtrack” is like a truffle mushroom: a delicacy that only seems inedible at first.
                        <br>
                        <em><strong>“It wears her out, it wears her out”</em></strong>: “Idioteque” has a case for being the best dance song on this or any other album, but the title of Kid A’s sneakiest ass-shaker belongs to “The National Anthem”. Consider the individual elements. Item: one bass, muscular and funky. Item No. 2: drums, heavy on the hi-hats, which wouldn’t be out of place on a track by Miles Davis. Item No. 3: Horns, ecstatic, wild, with a hat-tip to bebop and Charlie Parker. Item No. 4: Lyrics as epic and vague as anything heard on a house mix (“Everyone around here/ Everyone is so near/ It’s holding on”). There’s anxiety and discord flitting about the edges, in keeping with the albums overall themes, but the core is imminently danceable.
                        <br>
                        <em><strong>“Anyone can play guitar”</em></strong>: The modular synth on“Idioteque” is the best example of one of the great accomplishments of Kid A, which was to make machines as emotionally expressive as any traditional instrument. The chord progression is a sample of four bars from an 11-minute computer symphony called “Mild und Leise” by Paul Lansky, itself a riff on an aria of the same name from Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde. With apologies to other influences like Brian Eno, Aphex Twin, and even Paul Lanksy, the tremulous tone of these modular synths — somewhere between an organ and a cello — owes more to Wagner’s romantic operas.

                        <br>
                    <em><strong>“For a minute there, I lost myself”</strong></em>: Near the end of “Optimistic”, the rhythm section fades out, only to return several beats per minute slower. Radiohead seems to be putting the brakes on their optimism; it’s almost a bridge between “Optimistic” and “In Limbo”, the former featuring the chorus, “Try the best you can/ The best you can is good enough,” and the latter “You’re living in a fantasy world.” It’s like coming down from a high, a return to cold reality.
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>“Get judged”</strong></em>: Kid A has been called “frustrating,” “dull,” and “incomprehensible,” all by smart people, all of whom love music. Even fans who enjoy it could make a case for several other Radiohead albums at the top position, and they wouldn’t be wrong. Music isn’t sports; there’s no such thing as a clear winner, and our purpose in ranking the albums isn’t to settle debates, but to provoke them. The argument for OK Computer, the other record we debated for the top spot, is simple: The brilliance of the songwriting is only matched by the accessibility of the songs. Pick any track and play it for nearly anyone who enjoys rock music, and they will likely find something to appreciate. The same cannot be said for Kid A, and so the argument for Kid A is more complicated.

                      <p>“There are many things to talk about”: At its best, science fiction functions as a funhouse mirror, taking real questions about ethics and existence and exaggerating them into aliens, monsters, and problems of time and space. For OK Computer, Radiohead’s third studio album, the band mostly abandoned the moody introspection of The Bends and Pablo Honey in favor of a detached, third-person perspective. It’s a satire of modern life, and in magnifying modern problems, the band tackles extra-terrestrials, androids, and other science-fiction staples. Of course, there’s more: politics as conspiracy, consumerism as religion, love as violence, and personal slights as capital crime. It’s dripping in irony, and like all the best of satire and science fiction, the ironies are covering up a deep well of disappointment.
                            <em><strong>“Siren singing you to shipwreck”</strong></em>: Bob Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues” is almost a litany of disaffection — a parade of different characters struggling to fit in and get by. In contrast, Radiohead’s “Subterranean Homesick Alien” is a study of a single lost soul so desperate to feel special that he fantasizes about being abducted by aliens. It has Dylan’s humor, his critical eye, turned on Radiohead’s longstanding preoccupation with loneliness. It’s a nice twist on the tale of an outsider — like a remix of “Creep” done by someone a few years older who wears a smirk instead of their heart on their sleeve.
                            <br>
                            <em><strong>“It wears her out, wears her out”</strong></em>: Has there ever been a more fun song written about pandering for votes than “Electioneering?” The lyrics “When I go forwards you go backwards/ And somewhere we will meet” aren’t just a cynical take on the relationship between elected officials and the public; it could also double as instructions for a line-dancing class. That jaunty guitar riff is one of Radiohead’s great toe-tappers, and there’s even a cowbell to highlight how much fun the politician is having when he says, “I will stop at nothing.”
                            <br>
                            <em><strong>“Anyone can play guitar”</strong></em>: The talking machine of “Fitter Happier” is one of the more cerebral touches on OK Computer, and the track most likely to be skipped on repeat listens. According to Spotify’s numbers, it’s been streamed about a half a million times less than any other song on the album. But that doesn’t make it uninteresting; in fact, it’s proof that Radiohead’s goals had expanded beyond writing great rock songs. On an album full of social commentary, “Fitter Happier” is the track that’s most obviously satirical; in this world, you can do all the things you’re supposed to do, exactly as the experts proscribe, but in the end you’ll wind up a soulless robot.  
                            <br>

                    <br>
                    <em><strong>“For a minute there, I lost myself”</strong></em>: Radiohead like to switch up time signatures the way Shakespeare liked to occasionally veer from iambic pentameter. When a strong rhythm has been established, any deviation will perk up the ear and give a clue to the character’s state of mind. One of the best examples of this is “Paranoid Android”. There are several brief explosions into double-time, and frequent breakdowns from 4/4 into 7/8 — a portrait of a mind that’s racing to conclusions and throwing itself down blind alleys.
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>“Get judged”</strong></em>: OK Computer was Radiohead’s most ambitious project to date, a funhouse mirror large enough to show the whole warped world. Here, Yorke is at his storytelling best, living right at the knuckle of satire and sentiment. The album was universally adored, a global hit, the kind of career-defining moment that would allow any band to tour successfully — and live comfortably — for years. Most of the time that would be a good thing, but for Radiohead, it came with its own set of problems. They had achieved mastery over their instruments and pushed their particular brand of guitar-driven rock as far as it could go. Later, they would push even further, taking their themes of alienation out into space and, in the process, alienating huge swathes of critics and fans. But for one album they managed to straddle the two worlds: the accessible rock’n’roll of their early years and the later wild experiments. For one glorious moment, they were everybody’s darling.

                          <em><strong>“There are many things to talk about”</strong></em>: Rainbows are faint despite their opacity, warm despite their consistency, and fleeting despite their illusion of permanence. For many, they symbolize the beauty of a world that escapes you as quickly as it welcomed you into it. That’s In Rainbows. Radiohead finally did away with the anger, the politics, and the dystopian worry in favor of crafting something intimate. There’s darkness in several songs, of course, but what In Rainbows chooses to focus on at the end of the day is the transience of life and how our mind walks on a separate path than our bodies.
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>“Siren singing you to shipwreck”</strong></em>: “15 Step” begins with isolated drums, a good portion of which is fed through Kid A-like electronics. Before Jonny Greenwood’s blissful guitar line slides into the picture as the melody, Radiohead has already created a clean pop song. That skittering drum intro follows in the footsteps of pop songstresses before it, from Amerie’s “1 Thing” all the way to Beyoncé’s “Run the World (Girls)”. There’s no better call to pop than an unstoppable drumbeat, and “15 Step” is Radiohead’s contribution to that pile.

                    <br>
                    <em><strong>“For a minute there, I lost myself”</strong></em>: Technically, “Faust Arp” is the only song on the album that changes (god bless that hopscotch-tempo jumping), so the most striking time-signature shift here isn’t actually a time-signature shift at all. “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi” introduces a break from the guitar treading for a couple dozen seconds of muted playback. “I get eaten by the worms,” Yorke sings about three minutes in, flushing everything out while he sing-talks in a daze. The reason “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi” is so comforting is because of its repetition. To suddenly rip that away elevates its original importance. On every listen, that change-up still hits like the shock of ice water in a heat wave: painfully calming, unknowingly necessary, and overwhelming in the best way possible.
                    <br>
                    <em><strong>“Get judged”</strong></em>: Whether they like it or not, Radiohead changed the game with In Rainbows in more ways than one. The album’s pay-what-you-want method gave birth to Bandcamp and dozens of other platforms, lighting a far bigger fire beneath the belly that was illegal downloading at the time. Distribution aside, In Rainbows is a physical album that goes from 0 to 100. Radiohead sweat out a rambunctious fever on only a few songs like “Bodysnatchers” (many more, like “Bangers & Mash”, were dumped on the bonus disc) in favor of slowing things down for the rest of the record without falling prey to the tropes usually associated with balladry. The airiness of the album is what gives the minute changes such empathetic motion. “Videotape”, one of its more subtle successes, drives this point home as the closer. In Rainbows sees Radiohead open themselves up emotionally without pushing themselves to redefine sound. Instead, they changed the economic side of the industry, creating a spacious album to soundtrack the highs and lows of that revolution as it unfolded — and continues to unfold to this day
